    "2. Add validation requiring the user's original ID and confirmation to match.\n",

    "\n",
    "    0. Try to go forward from page 0 when the original ID doesn't match the confirmation.\n",
    "    1. Successfully go forward from page 0 (the original ID should match the confirmation).\n",

    "        0. Entering the amount of weight the user wants to lose, or\n",
    "        1. Saying that the user didn't resolve to lose weight\n",
    "5. Transfer the seed function you wrote in steps 0-4 to `src/my_survey.py`, run the app, and repeat the exercise from step 5 in your browser. Additionally, see what happens when you try to go forward from the 0th page without entering your ID.\n",
    "6. Test your code with `make test`. Note that you'll have to set the test user's default response to the ID inputs on page 0 to make sure they match. Otherwise, your test users will get stuck."
