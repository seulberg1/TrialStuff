For example, suppose you have an `Input` asking the user some question to which there is a correct response, and the user can't continue until entering it. (We'll cover validation later.) Our test user, responding randomly, would be stuck on this page forever. Below, we'll learn how to set test users' default responses to avoid situations like this.\n",
